The DUT is connected with the Driver and the Monitor via interface. The Driver communicates with the DUT to see how the DUT reacts by sending and receiving signals. The signals that the Driver sends are coming from the Sequencer, they are called sequence items. The Monitor is there to passively check the pin-level behavioral of the interface and it sends sequence items to the coverage collectors or scoreboards. The whole construction is in the Agent, which is in the Environment , which is in the top test.
